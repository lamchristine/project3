You have been provided with MEAN Stack Application with user **authentication** fully baked in. Visitors to your site can sign up, login, and logout. Now it's time to add **authorization** so that only _certain_ visitors (i.e. _logged in users_) can `create`, `update`, and `destroy` blog posts.

#### Authentication vs. Authorization
**Authentication** is like the bouncer at a bar checking your drivers license. Does your face match the one in the picture (i.e. your username)? Do you know your birthdate? (i.e. your password)? Good. You're in.

**Authorization** is like the "Class c" on your license which gives you permission to drive cars. Only some motorists are allowed to ride 'motorcycles' and drive 'semi-trucks'.

## App Setup

1. Clone this repo.

1. From inside the project directoy, run `npm install` to install the required node modules.

1. In one Terminal window, run `mongod`, and in another, run `nodemon`.

1. Run the seed tasks (`node seed.js`) to create a default user and some posts.

1. Navigate to `localhost:9000` in the browser. You should see an empty page and an angry red error message in the Chrome console.

  > You should see `Error: ENOENT, no such file or directory '.env'` in your terminal

1. To fix it, add a ["dot env"](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/mean-auth-seed) file, called **`.env`**, to the root directory. Add this line to the file:

  ```
  TOKEN_SECRET=yoursupersecrettoken
  ```

  This is the secret your server will use to encode the JWT token for each user. Note that this file is listed in `.gitignore` because you never want to expose your secret tokens on github.

1. Before hooking up the front-end, test your server routes via Postman:
  * Send a `GET` request to `/api/me`. You should see the message: "Please make sure your request has an Authorization header."
  * Send a `POST` request to `/auth/signup` with a test `email` and `password`. You should see a token that was generated by the server.
    > Make sure to use `x-www-form-urlencoded` and send your data in the `body` of the request).
  * Send a `POST` request to `/auth/login` with the `email` and `password` you just used to create a new user. You should again see a token that was generated by the server.
  * Bonus: If you add your JWT token in the `Authorization` header like so: `"Bearer YOUR-UNIQUE-TOKEN"` you will be permitted/authorized to create/update/destroy blog posts.

## Challenge 1: CRUDing Blog Posts

You have been supplied with a `posts#index` controller that displays the current blog posts.

Your goal is to: Build out angular templates, controllers, and routes for `new`, `edit`, and `show`, with easy navigation between these pages.

#### 1.1 PostsNewController (`posts-new.controller.js`)
To begin, let's create a new angular controller, template, and route for creating a single blog post. 
  * When a user visits `/posts/new` on the client...
    * they should see an empty form
      * with a field for `title` (use `ng-model="postsNewCtrl.post.title"`)
      * and a field for `content` (use `ng-model="postsNewCtrl.post.content"`)
      * and a button to "save".
  * When a user clicks "save" (having filled out the form)...
    * they should trigger a `on-submit="postsNewCtrl.create()"` method on the `form`(!)
    * and the `create()` method should make an $http request to `POST /api/posts` using the data in `vm.post`.
    * and their post should be saved to the database
    * and the server should respond with the newly created post and `_id` (e.g. 12345)
    * and the user should be redirect to e.g. `/posts/12345`.

  function create() {
    $http
      .post('/api/posts', vm.post)
      .then(onCreateSuccess, onCreateError);

    function onCreateSuccess(response){
      $location.path('/posts/' + response.data._id)
    }

    function onCreateError(response){
      console.error("Failed to create post", response);
    }

  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Create Post" class="btn btn-block btn-info">
</form>

```
</details>

#### 1.2 PostsShowController (`posts-show.controller.js`)
  * When a user visits `/posts/12345` on the client...
    * they should make an `$http` request to `GET /api/posts/12345`...
    * and they should see the `title` and `content` of post 12345...
        - using e.g. `{{postsShowCtrl.title}}`
    * and a button to `edit`
      * and be redirected to `/posts/12345/edit` 
    * and a button to `delete`
      * and should trigger a `on-click="postsShowCtrl.destroy()"` method on the `button`(!)
      * and the `destroy()` methods should make an `$http` request to `DELETE /api/posts/12345`
      * and on success, be redirected to `/` or `/posts` (posts index).
      * BONUS: and see the message "Successfully deleted post" below the navbar.

```
</details>

#### 1.3 PostsEditController (`posts-edit.controller.js`)
  * When a user visits `/posts/12345/edit` on the client...
    * they should make an `$http` request to `GET /api/posts/12345`...
    * and see a pre-populated form for post 12345...
      * with a field for `title` (use `ng-model="postsEditCtrl.post.title"`)
      * and a field for `content`(use `ng-model="postsEditCtrl.post.content"`)
    * and a button to `Discard Changes`
      * and be redirected to `/posts/12345`
      * BONUS: and a pop-up, confirmation dialog that says "Are you sure you want to discard your changes?"
    * and a button to `Save Changes`
      * that should trigger a `on-submit="postsEditCtrl.update()"` on the `form`(!)
      * and the `update()` method should make an `$http` request to the server, using the data in `vm.post`
      * and on success, be redirected to `/posts/12345` (show).
    * and a button to `Delete Post`
      * that should trigger a `on-click="postsEditCtrl.destroy()"` on the `button`
      * and the `destroy()` method should make an `$http` delete request to the server
      * and on success, redirect the user to `/` or `/posts` (index)
      * BONUS: and a pop-up, confirmation dialog that says "Are you sure you want to delete this post?"

## Challenge 2: Add Authorization

We are using [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer#authloginuser-options) (an angular library), [JWT Simple](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-simple) (an npm library for creating and parsing JWT tokens), and our own custom `authentication` middleware (see `middleware/auth.js`).

Before adding *authorization**, please familiarize yourself with `middleware/auth.js`. Try to answer the following questions:
  * What is a JWT token?
    - Where does it live?
  * What does it mean to be "logged in"?
    - How does the server "log in" a user?
    - How does the client know a user is "logged in"?
  * What does it mean to "log out"?
    - How does the client "log out"?

> Mega Hint: Authorization is already in place for client & server routes like `login`. How is it done?

#### Objective
Your goal is to:
  * **Protect sensitive endpoints _on the server_** (like `post`, `put`, `delete`).
    - Only a logged in user should be able to hit API endpoints for creating, updating, and destroying blog posts (on the server).
  * **Protect sensitive endpoints _on the client_** (like `new`, `edit`, and the ability to `delete`).
      - Only a logged in user should be able to see the forms and buttons for creating, updating, and destroying blog posts (on the client).
      - Stretch Goal: A user should only be able to edit or delete _their own_ blog posts (on the client). They should not see options to edit or delete on posts that do not belong to them.

#### 2.1 Protecting Server Routes (Server)
You will want to use `auth.ensureAuthenticated` (see `middleware/auth.js`) in the route to find the current user (i.e. so that you can use `req.user` to access the current user).

<details>
<summary>Protected Server Routes Hint (Click Here)</summary>
```js
// server.js
app.post('/api/posts', auth.ensureAuthenticated, postsCtrl.create);
```
</details>

#### 2.2 Hiding Buttons from Visitors (Client)
* Only _logged in_ users should be able to see buttons for `new`, `edit`, and `delete`.
  - `ng-show="main.currentUser.isLoggedIn()"`
* **BONUS**: Only the _owner_ of the blog post should see options to `edit` and `delete` the post.
  - Given that you have access to a `post` object, and the `currentUser` object, inside your controllers, is there a way to determine ownership?

<details>
<summary>Ownership Hint (Click Here)</summary>
```js
someCtrl.post.user._id === main.currentUser.user_id; // watch out for undefined!
```
</details>

#### 2.3 Protecting Client Routes (Client)
* Only a logged in user should be able to visit pages for `new` and `edit`.
  - You will want to use `loginRequired` (see `public/scripts/routes.js`) in the route to ensure that only a logged in user can go to `new` and `edit` pages.

<details>
<summary>Protected Routes Hint (Click Here)</summary>
```js
// public/scripts/routes.js

.when('/posts/new', {
  templateUrl: 'templates/posts/new.html',
  controller: 'PostsNewController',
  controllerAs: 'postsNewCtrl',
  resolve: {
    loginRequired: loginRequired // this is the important part
  }
})
```
</details>


## Bonuses
1. Refactor to use a PostService (or a `Post` resource using `ngResource`), and inject your service into each of your post controllers.

1. Validate blog-posts! Ensure a user can't submit an empty title or content. (Use both backend AND frontend validations).

1. On the user profile page, the "Joined" date isn't formatted very nicely. Use Angular's built-in <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/date" target="_blank">date filter</a> to display the date in this format: `January 25, 2016`.
